# Tarzan-Catch-the-Bananas-Game
Built a fullscreen Pygame arcade game (“Tarzan: Catch the Bananas”) featuring menu/settings screens, pause/restart flow, and persistent high-score tracking. Implemented randomized falling objects with collision detection, power-ups (golden bananas, hearts, shields), and dynamic difficulty scaling across jungle levels. Integrated sprite animation, background music, and sound effects with user toggles for audio control.
